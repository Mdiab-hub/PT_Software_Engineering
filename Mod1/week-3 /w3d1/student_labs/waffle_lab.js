//What's the purpose of this application? To instruct others on how to heat up and prepare frozen waffles.
//The main goal of the program is to detail the process of heating and then eating a frozen waffle

//Take waffles out of freezer let them sit outside for about 1hr.
//Pre-heat oven to 350°F
//After oven is heated; place waffles in oven for about 10mins.
//Take them out of the oven
//Place them on plates
//Put syrup on waffles
//Grab a knife and fork from drawer
//Sit down at the kitchen table 
//Enjoy!

//Take waffles out of freezer let them sit outside for about 1hr.
//Create if-else statement to check whether or not you have waffles

/*if (waffles in freezer = true){ //; then take them out and let sit = 1hr. 

} else (go shopping at grocery store)*/


//Pre-heat oven to 350°F
//Run for loop to heat Oven to 350°F

/*for(let oven = 0; oven < 350; oven++){
   break
}
console.log('Ding')*/


/*const 
while (oven = heating)
if (waffles in freezer = true; then take them out and let sit = 1hr. ){

} else {go shopping at grocery store}

while (oven = heating the waffles for 10mins.){
    oven++

}

for (oven = 0; oven < 10; oven++){
    bake waffles
}*/

//go to fridge; how to create functions?
